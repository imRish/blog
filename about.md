Hey, I am **Rishabh Pandey**.

![Me]({{ site.url }}/images/rish.jpeg){:id="about-image"}


A software **consultant** who works with startups and companies to turn their ideas into web applications.

I've been a full-stack developer and trainer since 2014. I have built some neat applications in the SAAS space and other industries. I've been fortunate enough to work with some great people and built amazing relationships.

As an engineer, I enjoy implementing complex ideas in a simple way. My programming style emphasizes on cleanliness and maintainability.

When I'm not coding the next great thing, I'm busy making music and learning new stuff.

I specialize in the following languages and frameworks:
 * Laravel  /  PHP
 * Vue.js  /  Node.js  /  Electron.js  /  Javascript
 * SQL databases

[Get in touch](mailto:email@example.com) today if you'd like to work together!
