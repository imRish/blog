Hey, I am **Rishabh Pandey**.

![Me]({{ site.url }}/images/rish.jpeg){:id="about-image"}


A full-stack developer who works with startups and companies to turn their ideas into applications.

I'm a software consultant and trainer since 2014. I have worked on everything from small scripts to huge SAAS applications. I have built some amazing things for the web with some awesome and highly efficient people. As a software engineer, I enjoy implementing complex ideas in a simple way. My programming style emphasizes on cleanliness and maintainability. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient.

When I'm not coding the next great thing, I'm busy making music and learning new stuff.

I specialize in the following languages and frameworks:
 * Laravel  /  PHP
 * Vue.js  /  Node.js  /  Electron.js  /  Javascript
 * SQL databases

[Get in touch](mailto:email@example.com) today if you'd like to work together!
