### What do you want to do? (Not your job, but your work, now, tomorrow, and in the future)*
*If you’re having trouble answering this, you’re going to have trouble moving up, because you’ve abdicated your dream to whomever walks in the door next.*


---

### Who do you want to change, and how do you want to change them?

---

### How much risk? (from 1 [a little] to 10 [bet everything]), how much are you willing to put at stake to make the change you seek?

---

### How much work are you willing to do to get there? Be specific about the tradeoffs.

---

### Does this project matter enough for the risk and the effort you’re putting into it?

---

### Is it possible — has anyone with your resources ever pulled off anything like this?
